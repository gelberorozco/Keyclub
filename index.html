<h2>What is Key Club?</h2>
<p>
Key Club is the largest International High School service organization in the
world, empowers its members to lead and serve by cultivating leadership skills,
developing friendships, and performing community service.  Key Club members
have a passion for helping others and gain leadership skills they will carry
with them for a lifetime.  Key Club is an international student-led
organization which provides its members with opportunities to provide service,
build character and develop leadership.  Key Clubs are established in a high
school or equivalent institution.  A community-based club also may be
chartered. Elected officers can include president, one or more vice presidents,
secretary, treasurer, editor and one director from each class.

<h2>How Key Club Works</h2>
<p>
Key Club International is a self-governing, student-led organization. Each
year, Key Club members elect their student officers at club, district and
international levels during club meetings and district and international
conventions.
</p>
<p>
Key Club members receive guidance and support from adult volunteers, including
<b><a href="http://www.kiwanis.org/">Kiwanis</a></b> advisors, faculty advisors and district administrators.
Additionally, the Key Club International staff trains and assists the district
governors and international board members.
</p>
<p>
The organization is funded by nominal dues paid by every member.
