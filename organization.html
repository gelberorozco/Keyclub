  The organization was started by California State
  Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney,
  and vocational education teacher Frank C.
  Vincent, who together worked to establish the
  first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California,
  on May 7, 1925. Female students were first admitted in 1977,
  ten years before women were admitted to the sponsoring organization,
  Kiwanis International.
